**How to clone repository / Upload to Git:**
* There will be an option to clone a repository from GitHGub
* Once cloned, create a branch - I like to name mine ConnorDev so we can easily identify the changes made
* Change / add code to your branch 
* Once happy with your code, click on changes at the team viewer homepage and add a message then press **commit all**
* Sync outgoing commits by selecting **push**
* This will upload the branch and we can merge to main later when we look over it
